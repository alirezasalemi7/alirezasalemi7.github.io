## Research Projects
My research projects are introduced in the **Publication & Research** section.

## Selected Course Projects
- __AirHokey__ \
AirHockey is an online multiplayer distributed android game written using java and android SDK. This application uses Bluetooth to connect two devices and simulates a real air hockey game. Since Bluetooth has less power consumption than WIFI connections, a user can play this game for hours without massive waste of energy.  This game was developed for *Cyber Physical Systems* course. \
