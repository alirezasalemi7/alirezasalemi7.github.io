## Research Experiences

- **Pre-training Language Models with Focus on Summarization** \
under supervision of Dr. [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery). \
This research aimed to develop new Transformer-based language models that perform specifically well in summarization. We suggested three novel pre-training objectives and a new abstractive summarization dataset for the Persian language. Furthermore, we tested our models in few-shot and zero-shot situations too. Our models get SOTA results in all available Persian summarization datasets and many NLU tasks. Finally, Our paper entitled "[ARMAN: Pre-training with Semantically Selecting and Reordering of Sentences for Persian Abstractive Summarization]()" has been accepted in [EMNLP 2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/). \

- **Toxic Span Detection** \
under supervision of Dr. [Behnam Bahrak](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahrak) and Dr. [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery). \
This research aimed to develop new machine learning models to annotate toxic words of a tweet. We used statistic-based and keyword-based methods as traditional methods of detecting toxicity and compared them with new neural techniques like attention-based and NER-based models. Finally, Our paper entitled "[textit{UTNLP at SemEval-2021 Task 5: A Comparative Analysis of Toxic Span Detection using Attention-based, Named Entity Recognition, and Ensemble Models](https://aclanthology.org/2021.semeval-1.136/)" was published in [SemEval 2021](https://aclweb.org/portal/content/semeval-2021-international-workshop-semantic-evaluation). \

- **Decentralized Enforcement in Message-Based Systems** \
under supervision of Dr. [Fatemeh Ghassemi](http://www.fatemehghassemi.ir/). \
In message-based systems such as network-based intelligent systems, particular ordering of some messages may violate the desired properties such as confidentiality of data. To make such systems safe, we propose a confidentiality-based runtime enforcement decentralized algorithm that, given an automata-based specification of unwanted message sequences, prevents specific messages from being sent and assures that unwanted sequences are not formed. \

- **Model Learning in Software Product Lines** \
under supervision of Dr. [Hossein Hojjat](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~hh/) and Dr. [Mohammad Reza Mousavi](https://www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/mohammad.mousavi/). \
Ensuring software correctness is an essential discipline of software engineering. Many quality assurance techniques (e.g., model-based testing and model checking) require a model describing the system's behavior. In this research, we survey various methods of extracting behavioral models from software systems, focusing on software product lines. \
