## About me
Hi, I'm __Alireza Salemi (علیرضا سالمی)__ [\[CV\]](https://alirezasalemi7.github.io/files/myCV.pdf).

I am a PhD candidate at the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) in [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I am working at the [Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/) under the supervision of [Hamed Zamani](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/zamani/?_gl=1%2Aqu9jxh%2A_ga%2AMTc0MTM3NzM4LjE2NjMwMzcyMDY.%2A_ga_21RLS0L7EB%2AMTY2NDE1OTU3OC40LjEuMTY2NDE2MTIxNS4wLjAuMA..&_ga=2.267640839.822767476.1664150089-174137738.1663037206). My PhD and research are supported by the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/) in NLP. I am currently working as a Student Researcher at [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), developing interesting agents! I also worked for a year (June 2024 until May 2025) as a part-time Student Researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), working on improving personalization capabilities of Gemini and Gemma LLMs. Previously, I was a BSc student at the [school of electrical and computer engineering](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece) in [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), where I worked on natural language processing under the supervision of [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery).  

My research interests lie in natural language processing and machine learning when they meet information retrieval, i.e., retrieval-enhanced machine learning (a.k.a, RAG). Recently, I have been working on personalizing large language models, multi-modal information retrieval, multi-modal knowledge grounding, and designing a search engine for all RAG LLMs (like Google for LLMs but tailored to their needs)! Previously, I worked on text summarization, translation, and hate speech detection.
