## About me
Hi, I'm __Alireza Salemi (علیرضا سالمی)__ [\[CV\]](https://alirezasalemi7.github.io/files/myCV.pdf).

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) in [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I am working at the [Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/) under the supervision of [Hamed Zamani](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/zamani/?_gl=1%2Aqu9jxh%2A_ga%2AMTc0MTM3NzM4LjE2NjMwMzcyMDY.%2A_ga_21RLS0L7EB%2AMTY2NDE1OTU3OC40LjEuMTY2NDE2MTIxNS4wLjAuMA..&_ga=2.267640839.822767476.1664150089-174137738.1663037206). Previously, I was a B.Sc. student at the [school of electrical and computer engineering](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece) in [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), where I worked on natural language processing under the supervision of [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery). 

My research interests lie in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. I have recently worked on text summarization, translation, and machine learning problems. I am working on retrieval-enhanced machine learning and multi-modal information retrieval in my Ph.D. studies.
