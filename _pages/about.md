## About me
Hi, I'm __Alireza Salemi (علیرضا سالمی)__ [\[CV\]](https://alirezasalemi7.github.io/files/myCV.pdf).

I am a Fifth-year B.Sc. student at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). In the past four years, I have studied computer engineering at the [school of electrical and computer engineering](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece), focusing on software systems. My final thesis under the supervision of Dr. [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery) was training a new language model with novel pre-training objectives for the Persian language with a focus on abstractive summarization.

My research interests lie in natural language processing. I have trained many models for solving problems related to toxic content detection, text summarization, sentiment analysis, textual inference, and language modeling. Also, I worked on computer vision for a while, but my expertise is NLP.

Now, I'm looking for NLP positions in Canada or the US to pursue my education in my field of interest. It would be helpful to notify me if you were interested in working with me!
